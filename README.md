**Digital Empowerment Pakistan Machine Learning Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction**

**Domain: Machine Learning**

**Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on customer demographics and usage patterns. The model will help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving and take preventive actions. We utilize various machine learning techniques, including feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training with classifiers like logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data encoding, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key features that influence churn.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones.
Modeling: Training various models, including:
Logistic Regression

**Random Forests**

Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.
Key Files
churn_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation for data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
dataset.csv: Customer data used for training and testing the model (make sure to add the dataset or link to it if it's external).
